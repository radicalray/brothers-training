    <b><u>Trainee criteria</u></b><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>The main target group for this training are brothers who should be:
            <ul>
		<li>Between 25-45 years old;
		<li>Married, with a proper marital status, but single brothers can also be considered depending on their relative maturity in life and faithfulness in their service;
		<li>Have good character, with a good knowledge of the truth, and a willingness to commit to the time commitments of the training: one Saturday a month from 9 am to 1 pm and a regular (likely weekly) meeting with the leading brothers in their locality;
		<li>Have a normal church life, which should include regular meeting attendance on Lord's Day, prayer meeting, and home meeting, etc.
             </ul>
         <li>The second group would include all the brothers currently serving as leading ones, elders or responsible brothers functioning as such now in the church life, including those in their fifties and beyond. This group would attend as "auditors" who would be required to participate in all aspects of the training and who would even be responsible to carry out the training locally by reviewing and applying the training messages in the present church life and with the younger brothers who are being trained.
    </ul>
