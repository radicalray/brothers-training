Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: yuqiang<br/>
         Last Name: qin<br/>
         Email: yuqiangqin@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Campbell<br/>
         Language: Chinese<br/>
         Group Number: 2<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 27<br/>
         Attendees: Jeremy Chen, Wenjie Zeng, Yuqiang Qin<br/>
         Absentees: Mark Cheng, Robert Tien<br/>
         Study Report: We studied at 10/10/2015, for lesson 27. Prayed for 20 minutes. We need three dimensional coordination. God’s presence is the authority. We need to be broken and have a willing heart to be broken. We need to be open to brothers, need to be humble but not passive, and accepting the balances of others. We all want the results of coordination, the harmony, the authority, the life, the fruit.
We have fellowshipped the practical arrangements for the coming Lord’s Day meeting. The way for nourishing the gospel friends met during the last Lord’s Day blending picnic outing. We discussed about the small group meeting.
