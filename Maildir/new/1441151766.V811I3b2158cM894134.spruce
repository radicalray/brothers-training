Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Elbert<br/>
         Last Name: Tsay<br/>
         Email: etsay33@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: San Jose<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 21<br/>
         Attendees: Oun Ho Park, William Lee, Elbert Tsay, Abraham Lee, Aaron Morgan<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report: Q#1 : We need to know the Lord's recovery in Life not by speaking Life but living in Life. Without living, it does not have much meaning. Without seeing or knowing Life, our focus easily goes to outward activity or dead doctrine. If elders don;t know the Life, they cannot minister Life, discern the Life in others. The Lord's recovery has a purpose. God Himself becomes our Life. Without Life, everything is degraded. Recovery is the recovery of Life. Deviation from Life causes degradation. Lord's recovery is not sustainable without Life. Without Life, we also can be deceived. The discernment is from Life. What we need to see is a clear vision concerning what Life is. For this reason, we need to have definite prayers.

Q#2 : Triune God is Life. The Life spoken of in John is present in Christ compared to something to come in the coming age. John 1:4 said, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. This life is a person.  We can get life supply but cannot live life without Him being our person. We have the divine life by regeneration (John 3:6) and become the children of God (John 1:12-13)  John 10:10 said 'I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly. John 14:6 said "I am the resurrection and the life". He is a life that can withstand, overcome, and never be conquered or terminated by death. John 14:6 said "I am the way, the reality, and the life" He is a life that become our everything.

Q#3: Golden lampstand in Revelation depicts the Triune God in His chosen, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified people because His life is being worked into His believers. We need to see a vision of the churches as Golden lampstand - the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. 


How to maintain the Lord's recovery continuously as a whole? Real danger is oldness. Once we become old, everything start attacking us. Pride is a start of oldness like Laodecia. So we need the Triune God in Christ realized as the indwelling Spirit to be our life.<br/>
