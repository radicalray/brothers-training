Hi, <br/><br/> the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Harry<br/>
         Last Name: Sorensen<br/>
         Email: hdssjca@pacbell.net<br/>
         Locality: San Jose<br/>
         Language: Spanish<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 2<br/>
         Attendees: Alberto Pacheco, Pablo Fierros, Juan Carlos<br/>
         Absentees: Greg Espinosa<br/>
         Study Report:  1:45 to 3:30

  We opened with a 25 minute time of prayer and incorporated the "prayer/consecration" hand out we received at the beginning of the training.

  Some related verses were pray read for a period of 10 to 15 minutes.

   We fellowshipped regarding the origin of elders in the Bible as seen in Genesis.  (eight great figures).   We noted that the title elder was not used until Exo. 3:16, even though in Genesis we saw that in reality the "eight great figures" were elders "leading ones".  One brother shared that there was a transition in Exodus from the age of "individuals" becoming the age of a corporate Body (Exo. 19:6).  He pointed out that an eldership was was formed due to the need of administration since there was now a kingdom which made it necessary to have the law.  There was a need for this government which was administrated by a group of elders.

  There was some emphasis regarding elders and their not only being priest but that they are the more mature and experienced ones in life among the saints. One key factor was their dual role: Must draw near to God with a heart that cares for God's people spending much time in the Lord's presence bringing the saints before Him and able to read the saints according to God's view in order to receive God's instant revelation.

  A great deal of time was spent on the importance of the elders cooperation with the apostles.  It was pointed out that both the elders and apostles must follow the leading of the Spirit and out of this mutual cooperation the local churches would not disintegrate nor become paralyzed.  Any kind of resistance to fellowship and the Spirit's leading would cause the church to suffer. We rejoiced that the workers among us bring the apostles teaching and the apostles teaching is carried out through the elders.  
  The churches must draw their supply from the Body. There are two tracks (work and churches) which are maintained through mutual fellowship and going in the same direction since the railroad ties are kept in order through the mutual fellowship.
