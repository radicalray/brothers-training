         Study Report:     Since the church is theocracy, the appointment of elders is in the hands of God, or we can say, in the hands of apostles who were appointed by God because they submit to the authority of the Head and live in the spirit. Paul in his later ministry set up a good pattern for us - not appoint elders in a quick way, but need to consider the qualifications of the elders.
   There are 4 things to consider in the appointment of elders: (1) elders must submit to the authority; (2) elders must be experienced in life; (3) elders need to have functions; (4) elders need to be constituted with the divine knowledge of the basic New Testament truths.
   Also in the matter of appointing elders, the whole church must be spiritual. Not only the apostles who appoints the elders must be spiritual, but also the ones who are appointed as elders must be spiritual; moreover the saints who receive the elders' authority must be spiritual.
