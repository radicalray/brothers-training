Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: King<br/>
         Last Name: Sheng<br/>
         Email: shengkc@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Sunnyvale<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 0<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 20<br/>
         Attendees: Steve Lai; Jae Kang; Spencer Choi; King Sheng<br/>
         Absentees: Mike Lee; Tao Ma; <br/>
         Study Report: We felt this subject "Having a Clear Vision of the Lord's Recovery" is very related to both previous and current HWMR books. They are "The Main Contents of the Lord's Recovery" and  the first week of "The Need for a New Revival" which is "Reaching the Highest Peak of the Divine Revelation - The Vision of the Age". The central line of the truth in the divine revelation of the Word of God includes the Word in the beginning,  who is the triune God Himself, who has the eternal economy which centered on the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit to dispense Himself to us to produce the Body of Christ consummated in the New Jerusalem. In every age there is the vision of the age, and we have to serve God according to the vision of the age.

The central revelation of God and the Lord's recovery is God becoming flesh, the flesh becoming the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit  becoming the sevenfold intensified Spirit to build up the Body of Christ and that consummates the New Jerusalem. We deeply felt we could not just know these terminologies and need to spend our own time to dive into these truth, particularly the ten points listed in outline related to the content of the vision. We need to be constituted with these truth in order to shepherd saints one to one about God becoming man that man might become God in life and nature but not in Godhead.<br/>
