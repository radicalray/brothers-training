         Study Report: Lesson 19 Knowing God’s Plan, Government and Authority

We should have the vision of God’s economy, and live with this heavenly vision. The church is God’s flock. All saints need to shepherd each other according to God’s plan, government and authority in order to satisfy God. As  active responsible brothers, we need to support and shepherd the elders or other responsible ones in spirit and also humanly. 

The church is the good pleasure of God for the heading up of all things in Christ through the church as the means. As long as each of saints knows God’s plan, government and authority, we can build up God’s body together, be His coworkers in this heavenly process and also become one New Man. If without a thoroughly understanding of God’s plan for us, we can not build up our church life into the oneness, which is the good pleasure of God and the expression of His son.
