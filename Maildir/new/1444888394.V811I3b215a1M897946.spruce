Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Hugh<br/>
         Last Name: Wong<br/>
         Email: hughswong@hotmail.com<br/>
         Locality: Santa Clara<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 27<br/>
         Attendees: Ritero Chi, Warren Chung, Te Fang, Wen-Hsiang Hu, Robert Ju, Joseph Lee, Jorge Tan, Hugh Wong<br/>
         Absentees: Hui Wu<br/>
         Study Report: Much time was spent to pray at the beginning of the study time. We went over the referenced scriptures and pray-read some of the verses. We used the questions at the end of the message as a guide and went through both the outlines and portions of the ministry excerpts. Much of the fellowship was focused on the way of coordination and our experience in church services. After the brothers went through the questions, there were more prayers for our coordination in church services and the results of harmony, authority, life and fruit.<br/>
