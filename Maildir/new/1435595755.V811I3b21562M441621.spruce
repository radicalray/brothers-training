         Study Report: Lesson 16 The Character of an Elder (2)
1.Being Stable:
“Stable” means that not live, conduct our life or dealing things according to our own will, thoughts or preferences since our flesh is not a reliable source because of our worldly sins. For example, in our church life, all saints worldwide in lord recovery come to Prayer Meeting on every Tuesday. The prayer meeting is vital for Lord and His body. The meeting day never be changed according to our own will or schedule. 

An oversea saint come to US for summer training. While he stays in US, he still shepherds and calls to pray reading with saints, whom he shepherds at his homeland, even they are in different continents and in different time zones at this moment.

Brothers pray that we set our minds and hearts to be stable in our church life as Prophecy Daniel set his minds not to give up when facing any situation, from King’s meal to Lions’ den. We set our minds that we would pray and give ourselves to the Spirit of Jesus Christ whichever situation we are in. 

2. Having a concern for others:
A concern for others means that we care others well-being in both spirit and real life. We all have different needs in real life, as students, working class, or a family. We, as responsible brothers, should have loving hearts for the needs of saints’ life, not only listen to them and know about it, but also pray for them and give them help accordingly. More importantly we should care their grows in Lord, their spiritual well being. 

We pray that we can supply saints with abundant love in lord seamlessly and shepherd them with the riches and words of Lord all the time.

3.Being accommodating:
Solomon seeks an understanding heart for judging the people of Israel from Lord. Lord answered his request and gave Solomon an understanding as the sand that is on the seashore. We pray that each of us learns and grows in Lord every day so that we can be understanding and accommodating to all His people.
