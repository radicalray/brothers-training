         Study Report: We went over the three study questions in detail.
The largeness of heart is the first necessary condition of an elder/leading one's heart.  God gave Solomon, in addition to wisdom, also a large heart.  If you enlarge your heart, you will become  the wisest person.  Honesty does not refer to the absence of lying and cheating (outward behavior).  Honesty refers to truthfulness and genuineness (inward condition).  
Upright means that there should not be any motive or aim in one's heart.<br/>
         Suggestions:  None.<br/>
