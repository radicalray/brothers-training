Hi, <br/><br/> the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Gopal<br/>
         Last Name: Shetty<br/>
         Email: gopalkris_shetty@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Brentwood<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 9<br/>
         Attendees: Gopal, Samuel Ho from Stockton<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report:  Elder is one who manages his house well.
Managing well our own household is a proof that 
one is qualified to take oversight of a local church,
Elder should lead by being a living example so that other members of the church can follow
It is dangerous to bring a new believer into the church lest he may be blinded with pride.
Those who are taking the lead must be in fear and trembling, praying that the Lord will preserve them from any kind of pride
The qualifications listed in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 are actually a revelation of how much the resurection life of the indwelling Christ can do in us.
eg self control is altogether a matte of life.
an elder must live  a life that has been dealt with 
by the cross of Christ so that resurrection power   
will operate in us.
We need to cooperate with Him by having a desire and a willingness and by praying much
If we wait on the Lord, He will work out all these things from within us<br/>
         Suggestions: I would have liked to go to the middle aged training. But I am not able to go.
But Praise Him this training is of much help to me  <br/>
