         Study Report:    In this lesson we have learned the relationship between church administration and authority, to know authority, to submit to authority, to be authority and not exercise authority. As long as there is a church, there is the need for administration. Once there is administration, immediately there is the matter of authority. If there is no authority, then there will be no administration.
   To know authority is to encounter the authority. There is something that you cannot offend, damage, rebel to. If you do so, it will cause you to lose the life and the peace within, and you cannot live before God.
   An elder is God's delegated authority in the church. To be authority, he needs to learn to submit to authority. Submission is different from obeying. When we find the authority proposing something that is wrong, we can still submit without obeying to the things that is wrong. To submit to an authority is an attitude, and it is a matter of your spirit.
   To be authority, the elders need to learn to neither nullify everyone's feeling, nor will they allow everyone to say whatever they want. And the best way to exercise authority is not exercising authority.
