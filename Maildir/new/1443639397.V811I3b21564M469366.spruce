Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Jeffrey<br/>
         Last Name: Guo<br/>
         Email: ucdjeffrey@hotmail.com<br/>
         Locality: San Francisco<br/>
         Language: Chinese<br/>
         Group Number: 4<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 25<br/>
         Attendees: Eddy Choy, Daniel Chang, Benjamin Lau,Roger Woo, Richard Zhang, Jeffrey Guo<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report: Lesson 25 the discernment of the elders
An elder need to have the spiritual discernment in church life in order to manage the church matters. A good way to have or develop the spiritual discernment is through learning and experience. The doctrine we receive from bible is the fundamental in this matter. More practically, we need to judge our own motive and intention in everything before God. If we can easily notify our impure motive or mixed intention, overtime we will develop or have the spiritual discernment over other matters. We pray that every responsible brother in church life to gain the spiritual discernment through solid learning, praying and carrying the cross before God. 
<br/>
         Suggestions:  Can we provide the fruit, such as apple or banana instead of cookies, for the break during training? So many brothers would not feel sleepy during the training!<br/>
