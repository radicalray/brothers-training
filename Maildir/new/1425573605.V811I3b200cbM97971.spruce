         Study Report: Lesson 4
The Function of the Elders
 
Study group meeting on 03/01/15, 1pm to 2:30

30 minutes of prayer

Brother (1 ) Shared on the elders being mature in life 

Brother (2) In this portion of the word we see that the establishment eldership has to be related to life and the leading of the Holy Spirit.

Brother (3) The appointment is based upon manifestation and the leading of the Holy Spirit.

Brother (2) pointed out the difference of the term of elder and overseer.   The title Elder being related to a brother being mature in life and overseer being related to the the function of an elder.  However, this is not a controlling function; but still one serving as a slave.  The oversight is in order to supply, protect and lead the flock 

Brother (1) Shared that we do not vote in our elders. Also, I.A. 4. I was touched by what Peter said in I Pet. 5:2. No lordship over them but willingly and according to God.  I Pet. 5:2-4 

Brother (2) Not according to our preference but according to God’s view, purpose and interest.  Also under letter “B”.  Also the matter of being “apt” to teach under “C”  (I Tim 5:17a).   Point #2 is huge since we can get too busy to stop and spend time in His presence.  

Brother (3) Felt that the best teaching takes place in the homes.  Also, the elders must oversee according to God’s choice, desire, intention, and preference; according to God’s likes and dislikes.

Bro (3) We are all serving brothers in the Lord as slaves to the saints.  Life Study 32 of I Peter:  The elders should regard themselves as slaves, and the brothers and sisters as their masters.
