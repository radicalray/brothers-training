Hi, <br/><br/> the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Gopal<br/>
         Last Name: Shetty<br/>
         Email: gopalkris_shetty@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Brentwood<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 7<br/>
         Attendees: Gopal, Samuel Ho from Stockton<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report: Prayed and Studied the outline while driving together to Anaheim ITERO . 
Read the excerpts and answered the questions.
The eldership depends mainly on life, not ability or gifts. Throughout church history the problems in eldership have been mail matters of life.
It takes time to to know a person in life, at least a year.  Hence it is better to go slower in the selection of an elder.

Aspiring to overseership is holy, with a pure motive to serve.
Being ambitious to be an elder is impure motive
Ambition and competition damages the Church
Five qualifications of elders:
1. Without reproach ie irreproachable condition in the eyes of man.
2. Husband of one wife impling the restraint of the flesh
3. Temperate denoting moderate, balanced
self controlled
4. Of sober mind ie to be sensible and also discreet in understanding
5.Orderly ie to be decorous ie to have a behaviour that always fits the situation



<br/>
         Suggestions:  Praise the Lord brother Samuel from the Church in Stockton and I had the opportunity to blend by way of our group study.<br/>
