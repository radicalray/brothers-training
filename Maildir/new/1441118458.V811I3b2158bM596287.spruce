Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Elbert<br/>
         Last Name: Tsay<br/>
         Email: etsay33@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: San Jose<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 20<br/>
         Attendees: William Lee, Elbert Tsay, Abraham Lee, Aaron Morgan<br/>
         Absentees: Oun Ho Park<br/>
         Study Report: Qn #1: What are the contents of the vision of the Lord's recovery?

It is God's plan from eternity past to eternity future, both the corporate and individual aspect of Christian life. We should know this vision not by studying, but going through situations and experiences (not individually, but being with others). This vision should control us. Do we really know the contents of this vision? How much do we understand?

Qn #2: How should the elders teach the vision concerning the Lord's recovery to the saints?

We should base upon discerning the needs, and teach the truth (perhaps 1 on 1), gradually infusing truth into the saints. We should discern any lack, and look on how to cover the lack by imparting truths to the saints. Go and shepherd the saints; this is not done in a big meeting.

Qn #3: What does it mean to be governed by the vision of the Lord's recovery and how can this vision become a safeguard to us?

A clear and fresh vision will safeguard us: a vision that's always timely and always now. We should never be confident of how clear our vision is, but strive to find the clear vision. If we are confidence of the clear vision, then there's a danger to us for falling behind. Our vision needs to be constantly refreshed and clear. Only then it can govern us with a living vision.<br/>
