Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Cheng-Chuan<br/>
         Last Name: Lai<br/>
         Email: cclai31@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Roseville<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 18<br/>
         Attendees: Steve Anderson, Cheng-Chuan Lai,Roman Pechenyuk , Bill Janzen<br/>
         Absentees: Gary and Scott (both out of the country)<br/>
         Study Report:    In this lesson we have learned how the elders to be God's delegated authority in the church. They need to be the authority in love, in spirit, in resurrection, in patience, with discernment, in coordination, and not exercising authority.
   Love is the basis of authority and the power behinds it. Love is the authority transformed. The amount love you have determines the amount authority you have. You must love brothers and sisters, and this love becomes your authority.
   We also need to be authority in spirit. Not only the elders need to live in spirit daily, but also to handle church affairs in spirit. Then they will impart life to others through carrying out practical matter. And the life is also the authority transformed.
   Then the elders need to be authority in resurrection. Every time when the elders need to something in the church, to express some attitude, or to voice some opinion, they need to put them under the cross and let the cross to filter out everything natural. Only that which is left after testing of the cross are in resurrection, and can be presented.
   Finally, the elders need to be authority in patience and in coordination. To be in patience means that to have hope in others despite encountering many troubles. No matter how much work you have invested in others, and no matter how terrible the result is, you still have hope in hem. Patience is to be able to endure setbacks in your work; when you are repeatedly mistreated, yet you still hold on.
O Lord, have mercy on us!<br/>
