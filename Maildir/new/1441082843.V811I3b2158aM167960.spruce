         Study Report: Elders need to know Lord's recovery in life.
Life is mysterious and difficult to define and share with others, but our eyes need to be opened to see that the Lord's recovery is a recovery back to life.
The Bible establishes the principle that the degradation of Christianity is a deviation from life. This began from the last part of the first century.
The last ministry in the Bible is John's mending ministry which uniquely brings the believers back to life.
We all need to pray definite prayer asking the Lord to show us a clear vision of life.<br/>
         Suggestions:  Excellent format<br/>
