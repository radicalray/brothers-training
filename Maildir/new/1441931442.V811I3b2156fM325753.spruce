Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Cheng-Chuan<br/>
         Last Name: Lai<br/>
         Email: cclai31@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Roseville<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 22<br/>
         Attendees: Steve Anderson, Cheng-Chuan Lai,Roman Pechenyuk , Bill Janzen<br/>
         Absentees: Scott<br/>
         Study Report: The elders need to know the Lord's recovery in truth. Truth is not merely doctrine, but is the content of the Bible. It is the reality conveyed in the doctrine, and is realized through the Spirit. We need to realize that the truth is light shining,  and the light is life to us. So the elders should spend time to study the Bible to receive the doctrine. Then as the elders, we need to exercise the spirit to pray in a proper way to open to the Lord, to deal with the Lord, to touch the Lord, and let the Lord touch us, deal with us, especially our conscience. Then we can hold the truth in pure conscience, and let the Spirit operates to enlighten us, and make the truth become light. God is light, and in Him is life. So the light becomes life to us.
We also need to know that the truth is God Himself, Christ Himself. Whenever we come to the Bible, we must touch God; otherwise, the Bible will be just merely doctrine instead of truth to us. If we do not get God from reading and teaching Bible, what we have is just doctrine. Then we will be in the danger to fall into argument and disagreement in doctrine, which will cause division.
So it is very important for the elders to know the Lord's recovery in truth in order to know God and Bible, have light and light, and prevent from being divided.<br/>
