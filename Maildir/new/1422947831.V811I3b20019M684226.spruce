         Study Report:  The  origin of elders
God reveals his salvation from individual to corporate body in Exodus, thus it must have a administration among the children of Israel. This is the time where eldership and elder came in (Exo 3:16). Although power does come with administration, God’s desire was not a kingship; instead, elders has to contact with God and draws near to God. In addition, elders are need to be mature and experienced among the saints.

To a church, its  tide is high or low solely depends on the elders. If elders are spiritually rich, the church is spiritually rich and vice versa. To the leading, elders must follow the Holy Spirit and must cooperate with apostles who lead churches into fellowship and bring bring in the apostles’ teaching. Without so, church will become paralyzed.

For the eldership, the more elders in a church, the more grace bring in. For one is that it prevent anyone from becoming a king, for another one is burden can be share among elders. Moreover, each elder has their own capacity and functionality, which would become strong testimony from the church.
