         Study Report:  The matter of managing our own household was made clear. The concept of Paul in this section regarding the elders is on the overseers' living. In this light, the way to lead and manage our household well is by having a living that presents a positive pattern to them; this depends on what we are. If we cannot be a good example to our children, we cannot be a good example in the church. The basic concept here is that the elders should lead not by ruling with authority but by being a living example so that the others could follow.

It is easy to be proud when a person is put in a special position in a group. That is why it is dangerous to bring a new convert to the eldership. If an elder becomes proud, he will suffer the same condemnation as the devil.Being in an apprenticeship and having an attitude of learners will preserve us. We must be in fear and trembling, praying that the Lord will preserve us from any kind of pride.

We also must have a good testimony from those outside, who are not in the church, that we may not fall into the reproach and snare of the devil. We should clear past mistakes by confessing to those who were involved. For the future, we must look to the Lord and realize that it is by His mercy that we are an elder, and also be careful because Satan will continually seek opportunity to damage us as those who care for God's house, the church.

Holding to the faithful word is key to maintaining good order in the church. Such faithful word is according to the teaching of the apostles and enable us to stop troublesome talkers and calm a tumultuous situation. It enables us to convict those who contradict by exposing the true character of a matter, so as to convict and reprove by exposing one's fault.

All these qualifications are a revelation of what the Lord can do within us, how much the resurrection life can do within us. On our side must cooperate with Him by having a desire and a willingness and by praying much. The current realization is that He indeed is doing such a work in us through this training. Amen, do it Lord Jesus!
