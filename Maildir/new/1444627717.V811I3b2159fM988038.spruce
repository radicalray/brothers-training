Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: King<br/>
         Last Name: Sheng<br/>
         Email: shengkc<br/>
         Locality: Sunnyvale<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 6<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 26<br/>
         Attendees: Tao Ma, Jae Kang, Steve Lai, Mike Lee,  Spencer Choi, King Sheng<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report: There are 5 points in lesson 26 of the coordination of the elders. We reviewed them all, particularly we we enlightened by the  truth of the elders being a miniature of the Body. 

We read the excerpt: " ...., When the elders are together in coordination, they constitute the smallest form of this body, and as such they are the miniature of the Body of Christ." "In this age, God's greatest need is to have the church built up. Where there is no building, there is nearly no church." .... " In order for a church to be built up, there is first the need for the elders to be built up. How can a church be built up if its elders are not built up? ...., Therefore, the building and the coordination in the church are entirely in the hands of its elders, and they are dependent upon them. Moreover, the elders must be the initiators and the examples in the building of the church. If there is no real building and coordination among the elders, there will be no initiators of the building up and the coordination of the church.

We all need this kind of vision to control our living related to our church coordination.<br/>
