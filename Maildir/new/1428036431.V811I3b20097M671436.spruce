Hi, <br/><br/> the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Gopal<br/>
         Last Name: Shetty<br/>
         Email: gopalkris_shetty@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Brentwood<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 8<br/>
         Attendees: Gopal, Samuel Ho from Stockton<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report:  We took turn driving to Anaheim for the Itero
We used this opportunity for group study.
Lesson 8 is on the qualifications of elders (continued from lesson 7)
Hospitable or hospitality requires love (divine love), care for people and endurance.
The need to be hospitable is a severe test to the elders; it tests whether we love the members of the church and are compassionate, patient, and willing to sacrifice our time, our material possessions
Apt to teach means "inclined" to teach.
Elders must be concerned for the saints' learning and build up a willingness and habit
to teach the saints
Qualifications of the elders relates to controlling three kinds of lusts:
1. To be the husband of one wife is to control Sexual lust
2. To be temperate, not a striker, and not contentious but gentle is to control our temper
3. To be not fond of money is to bridle our lust for money.
An elder must be one who exercises strict control of these three things

 <br/>
         Suggestions:  I feel we need to pray to epen to the Lord more to infuse more life into us so that 
we can meet the qualifications <br/>
