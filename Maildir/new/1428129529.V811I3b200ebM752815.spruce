Hi, <br/><br/> the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Ritero<br/>
         Last Name: Chi<br/>
         Email: ritero_chi@hotmail.com<br/>
         Locality: Santa Clara<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 7<br/>
         Attendees: Robert Ju, Hugh Wong, Ritero Chi, and Richard<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report:  We very much use the study questions as a guide for our fellowship.

In regards to life being more important than ability in deciding whether a brother should be an elder points to the importance of what we are, of our person. Only what we are in life counts for the eldership.It takes time to know a person in life, at least one year of regular contact. Time plus environment exposes a person. 

In regards to the difference between aspiring to overseership and ambition to be an elder, the key seems to be the motive. The aspiration to the overseership should be driven by a burden for the church, to care for the Lord's interest. The example of a man aspiring to be a good father was a good help in seeing that.

As brother Minoru previously shared, as we consider and enter into all these qualifications, they become like little mirrors exposing us from every angle. That is becoming more and more the case. There seems no way to escape the exposing except by turning to spirit and being in our spirit all the time.
