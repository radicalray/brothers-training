Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Jeffrey<br/>
         Last Name: Guo<br/>
         Email: ucdjeffrey@hotmail.com<br/>
         Locality: San Francisco<br/>
         Language: Chinese<br/>
         Group Number: 4<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 17<br/>
         Attendees: Daniel Chang, Jeffrey Guo, Roger Woo, Benjamin Lau<br/>
         Absentees: Eddy Choy, Richard (Wen) Zhang<br/>
         Study Report: Lesson 17    The Authority of the Elders (1)

       1) Authority and administration:

In our church life, we have the authorities, become authorities and responsible ones, over certain matters because we respect the authorities and the ones with the authorities. If we do not have the heart to respect the authorities, we will not be empowered with it by God.

      2) and 3) Knowing authority and  submitting to authority

In church life, the authorities are from God. Our church life are built upon these authorities. Because of it, we have peaceful mind among saints and in church life. In a family, when the children rebel against their parents, they would have troubles with their parents. If we do not know and submit to the authorities, we would not have peaceful minds, hearts and spirits in our church life since we do not understand the authorities spiritually.

Because Daniel submit to God authorities, he was not hurt by Lions when he was put into the den of lions. He said that My God hath sent His angel , and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me. 

We pray that we set our minds to submit to the God authority whichever situation we are in.

      4) On being the Authority 5) not exercising authority

Moses is the model of being an elder for God’s people. He has the authority, from God, over Israel people. But he never exercise his authority over God’s people. Whenever he faces some issues or complaints from Israel people, he turns to God and pray for it. 

We pray that we have the heart and spirit of being the authority, but submitting to God in our church life.
