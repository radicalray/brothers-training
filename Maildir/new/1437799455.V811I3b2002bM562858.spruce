Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Gopal<br/>
         Last Name: Shetty<br/>
         Email: gopalkris_shetty@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Brentwood<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 18<br/>
         Attendees: Gopal Shetty and brothers from Pleasanton<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report: Q. 1 What does it mean for an elder to be an authority in love?
Ephesians 5 mentions the matter of the husband as the authority It says that the wives to submit to their husbands.  God only charges the husbands to love their wives That tells us clearly that the way for a husband to behave as authority is in love.
Ephesians 6 also mentions that the parents are an authority especially father. Good parents discipline their children absolutely in love.
To be an authority is simply love, we have to love the church, to love the brothers and sisters, 
this love will then become our authority.
Q2. How can elder be an authority in spirit?
To be in spirit is to be in God's presence; it is allow God to rule within us:
where there is God's presence, there is authority;
authority is simply God Himself.
In order for the church that we are overseeing to be in life and with anointing, 
every arrangement we make in the church  must be in spirit.
Q3 What does it mean for an elder to be an authority in resurrection and in patience?
To be in resurrection means that all of our actions have to pass through the cross
When we filter what we are going to say, along with all our thoughts, intentions, motives, and goals, 
through the death of the cross, we are filtering out everything natural. 
Only that which is left after the testing of the cross can be presented.
For the elders to serve as the authority in patience means to having hope despite encountering many troubles.  Patience is not procrastination.  
No matter how much work we have invested in others, and no matter how terrible the result is, 
we still have hope in them<br/>
