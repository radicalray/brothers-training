Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Gopal<br/>
         Last Name: Shetty<br/>
         Email: gopalkris_shetty@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Brentwood<br/>
         Language: <br/>
         Group Number: 0<br/>

         Study Report: 1.Why is Character imp. in the practice of the eldership?
Those brothers who are elders in the Church and who serve God's house are engaged in the highest professional undertaking in the universe. As such they must pay full attention to the matter of character.
The demands upon a person's character increases as his undertaking becomes lofty
Experience has shown that in order for the elders to be a true profit their character must be carefully considered.  
The walk and conduct of every person is definitely restricted by his character
2. What is the relationship between our character, habits and hereditary nature?
Our nature (disposition) comes completely from the hereditary traits, it comes by birth.
Our character is developed from our hereditary nature plus our han=bits
Within the character % of habits(60-70%) is higher than that of nature
3. Explain what it means to be thorough and how we can should build up a thorough character in our listening to the people?
An example of being thorough is to listen seriously and inquire seriously, listen accurately so that we can 
repeat accurately
4. What is diligence and how can the elders develop the habit of diligence?
Diligence is opposit of slothfulness.  
Opportunity is the seizing of time. Whoever seizes time is a diligent person
Once a matter is placed in our hand we should not place it in the shelf;
everything in our hands must be carried out diligently
A diligent character is ninety percent developed through habit.
To overcome our slothfulness and develop the habit of diligence,
we must start with our own personal matters, both great and small
If you put something into the hands of a lazy man, he will surely make an important matter look small
and a small matter to be nothing
If you put something in the hand of a diligent man, he will make something out of nothing, and make a small thing into something big
