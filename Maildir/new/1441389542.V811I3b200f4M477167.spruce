Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Gopal<br/>
         Last Name: Shetty<br/>
         Email: Gopalkris_shetty<br/>
         Locality: Brentwood<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 23<br/>
         Attendees: Gopal, Chris, Daniel, Eric, Gary, Ron<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report: The old man refers to our very being, the created and fallen man.
The natural man is our natural ability, capability, method, wisdom and knowledge
The self denotes the soul life in its 
 1. Opinion, matter of mind
 2. Likes and dislikes, matter of emotion
 3. Choices, matter of will.

Question 2 
In the Lord's recovery there is no place for the self and the old, natural being.
We must crucify, reject and deny the self with its opinions, preferences and choices
In the sense of the new creation, there is a place for us in the church, as regenerated persons
who are being sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified.

Q.3
Lord I need to see more of the vision of Your recovery in life and truth.
I also need to know my old, natural being.
My natural man with its strength , ability and talents must be terminated.
Lord mingle Yourself with my new being that I may live together with You.
If we realize that a brother is serving or speaking by his natural ability,
We should not do anything.

Q4.
In the church life we need a vision that the natural man must be terminated 
Then we will serve in resurrection
