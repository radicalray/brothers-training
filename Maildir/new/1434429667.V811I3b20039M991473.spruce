Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Jeffrey<br/>
         Last Name: Guo<br/>
         Email: ucdjeffrey@hotmail.com<br/>
         Locality: San Francisco<br/>
         Language: Chinese<br/>
         Group Number: 4<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 15<br/>
         Attendees: Eddy Choy, Daniel Chang, Jeffrey Guo, Roger Woo, Richard (Wen) Zhang<br/>
         Absentees: <br/>
         Study Report: 1.our habits are from the environment in which we live. we adopt whatever the environment provide for us. as time passes, whatever we adopt from our daily living environments becomes part of us. The brother mentioned that Abraham changed his old habits by following the Lord to leave his father home without any old habits. Even Moses gave up his prince status, or old prince habits, by following the Lord to leave for wildness. after 40 years of wildness life, Moses became a different person, who were able to listen to the Lord and rescue the people of Israel out of Egypt. If we have goods habits,  which can be used by the Lord, the Lord will have the way through us. 

3.Jesus once said that a patient needs the doctor, a healthy person doesn't need the doctor. When people around us need our help, we should be like a doctor to them. We pray that we can be thorough for His economy and our church life.

4. we pray that we need to be diligent in our church life. The king david used to face his enemy personally and fight every battle in person with his people. When his kingdom settled, he started instructing his people to fight battle for him so that he had the time committing a terrible sin, which he did not even realize it until God told him. 

Finally, we pray that May Lord give us strength to train ourselves to change our own habits and our nature.
