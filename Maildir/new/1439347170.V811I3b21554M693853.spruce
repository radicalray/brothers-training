Hi, the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: King<br/>
         Last Name: Sheng<br/>
         Email: shengkc@yahoo.com<br/>
         Locality: Sunnyvale<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 0<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 19<br/>
         Attendees: Steve Lai; Spencer Choi; King Sheng<br/>
         Absentees: Mike Lee; Tao Ma; Jae Kang<br/>
         Study Report: Although we have only 3 brothers met together, we exercised our spirits and share all the questions and answers together. We were touched that the following points:
1. An elder must have a very clear revelation and thorough vision concerning the position, the importance, the process, and the consummation of the church in God's plan; only then will he know what the church is that he is managing; and what is its position and nature. May the Lord grants us such clear revelation and thorough vision about the church.
2. Every elder has to see that God has His government in the universe, and He also has His government in the church; every one who lacks a vision concerning God's government will be unable to serve satisfactorily as an elder before God. We shared that those who left the recovery may not see the government in both aspects. Lord, we need to see God's government in both universal and local aspects.
3. The New Testament shows us clearly that the authority of the church is entrusted to the elders and is completely in the hands of the elders. Although the elders are appointed by the apostles, God has not entrusted the authority of the church to the hands of the apostles.<br/>
