Hi, <br/><br/> the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Harry<br/>
         Last Name: Sorensen<br/>
         Email: hdssjca@pacbell.net<br/>
         Locality: San Jose<br/>
         Language: Spanish<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 3<br/>
         Attendees: Alberto, Greg, Juan Carlos, Pablo, Harry<br/>
         Absentees: None<br/>
         Study Report:  Summary of Spanish Speaking Group 
Church in San Jose
 Date: 02/08/15
All four Spanish speaking brothers were present as well as myself.
Time: 1:30 to 3pm - followed by coordination meeting for 30 minutes
Lesson #3  "The Position of the Elders"
Prayer: 1:30 to 1:55pm
Prayer-read Consecration Prayer: 1:55 to 2:05pm
 Pray-read the following verses and foot notes:  2:05-2:35
 Exo. 28:30; Num. 27:21; Deut. 16:18;  Acts. 13:1-4; Tim. 1:3-4 & Acts. 2:42
Fellowship our experiences as it relates to the Word, footnotes, outline and Ministry excerpts.
The main fellowship was related to three areas:
1. God's administration in the O.T. and that the children of Israel were governed and ruled by means of theocracy, by God directly yet through some priest and elders. In the O.T. the brothers realized and shared that the law was God's constant speaking. In addition, there was the instant speaking of God through the High priest as revealed to him through the breastplate by means of the Urim and the Thummim.  The brothers realized that the constant and instant speaking of God was necessary.
2.  There was a great deal of time spent on N.T. of God's constitution being different from the "O.T. law."  That today the N.T. Constitution is the Teaching and Fellowship of the Apostles and that it does not include practices such as baptism, Lord's table and etc. 
3. The brothers in general felt that the "work" and the "churches" is much like a married couple and must be fully dependent on each other.
