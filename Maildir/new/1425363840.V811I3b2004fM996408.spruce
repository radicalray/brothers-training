Hi, <br/><br/> the following is the report you have submitted: <br/><br/>First Name: Chris<br/>
         Last Name: Barton<br/>
         Email: bartonchris@live.com<br/>
         Locality: Pleasanton<br/>
         Language: English<br/>
         Group Number: 1<br/>
         Lesson: Lesson 5<br/>
         Attendees: Raju, Chris, Yan, Edward<br/>
         Absentees: N/A<br/>
         Study Report: Start:  7am; End ~8:45;  After ~20 minutes of testing and feedback/critique, the majority of time all 12 brothers fellowshipped the lesson then we broke out into our group study times.  Was more emphasis on practice of prayer and exercise of the spirit during this session compared to past sessions.  Need to continue to make progress in this area.  Fellowshipped the matters of  authority, growth in life and function (and function is the lower priority qualifier) at length.  Also drew some connections and deeper understanding for why Paul changed his way of appointing elders to wait longer.  If the spirit is weak in a new locality the connection with the Holy Spirit may be too weak to verify & appoint an elder.  This helps us realize that the condition of the saints (not just the apostle(s)) is one of the key factors for the appointment of elders.  Also realized that each locality is different.  Some may have only responsible ones for many years until an 
 elder ca
 n be properly appointed.  Also learned that many local churches have "elders" that may have been appointed without the Holy Spirit making the appointment.
